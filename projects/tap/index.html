        <h3>What is Tap?</h3>
        <p>
            Tap is a simple application meant to allow anyone keep track of the number of times something occurs.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why keeping track counts</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assists in forming new habits or break old ones by tracking a goal.</li>
            <li>Replaces the analog "clicker", typically used for counting people or inventory, but you can count whatever you want.</li>
            <li>You can use it to track how many moves it takes you to beat your friend in chess.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap to increment the count</li>
            <li>Gesture support - Swipe down with two fingers to decrement the count</li>
            <li>Haptic Feedback(Only available on supported devices)</li>
            <li>Editable counter name</li>
            <li>Over 20 different button colors to choose from</li>
            <li>A counter reset</li>
            <li><a href="/projects/tap/xcallback">x-callback support</a></li>
            <li>Dark Mode</li>
            <li>And many more to come...</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>More about Tap</h3>
        <h4>Why make another "counter" app?</h4>
        <p>
            I wanted to make an application that was a simple concept but would also allow me to become creative with
            what features I can add in the future. How the application looks and feels to the user is also very important
            to me, this is why I wanted to put extra emphasis on making the application beautiful.
        </p>
        <h4>Behind the scenes</h4>
        <p>
            I am a passionate mobile developer and I love to build things, pushing myself out of my comfort zone
            and most of all I love to learn. I started this project to explore a new architecture and to write a blog about my experiences
            with the architecture. In the process I realized that I was making something that I was really proud
            of and I wanted to share my creation. I still have ambitions to write about this journey in a series
            of blog posts and I will proudly share the link once I have started. Thank you for your support!
